# Masterblog Project: A dynamic web application

In the following school project I'll be building a blog.  
I’ll be able to view all posts, delve into each one for more details, add new posts, and delete any I don’t want anymore. 

This exercise will give me hands-on experience with important Flask concepts such as routing, 
template rendering, form handling, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

How it looks so far:
