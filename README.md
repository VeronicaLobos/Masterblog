This project helped me learn key web development concepts like routing, template rendering, form handling, and CRUD operations.

## Tech Stack

*   **Flask:** This is a really cool Python framework that makes building web applications much easier.
*   **HTML:** This is the basic structure of the web pages.
*   **CSS:** This is what makes the blog look nice and stylish.
*   **JSON:** This is a way to store data in a structured format. I use it to save the blog posts.
*   **Python:** This is the programming language that makes everything work.

## What's Masterblog All About? ðŸ¤”

*   **Easy Post Creation:** Quickly add new posts with a simple form.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The blog automatically displays all your posts.
*   **Full Control:** Edit or delete your posts whenever you want.
*   **Likes:** Show your appreciation for posts.

## Key Features

*   **Route:** Direct users to different parts of the website.
*   **Render Templates:** Create dynamic web pages.
*   **Styling:** Made some nice looking pages with colorful buttons.
*   **Handle Forms:** Collect information from users.
*   **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.
*   **OOP:** A class dedicated to serialize and deserialize data to and from the JSON file.  Designed for maintainability and better project organization.  In the future another module could handle other file formats like CSV.
*   **Data Persistence:** Posts are saved in a JSON file.
*   **Error Handling:** The app provides feedback if something goes wrong.
*   **Unique IDs:** Each post has a unique ID for easy tracking.
